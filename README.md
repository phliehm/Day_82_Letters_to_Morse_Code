# Day_82_Letters_to_Morse_Code
# Project for "100 Days of Code (Python)"

Goals: 

1. A python script which converts text to morse code
2. text (terminal) based program, no gui



Road map:

1. Greet user, tell the user what the program can do
2. Get text input
3. parse into single letters (how does morse code seperate letters and words?) --> list
(Is this needed? Can I not just go through the input string?)
4. make a dictionary {letter: morse code} (once)
5. build new string by looping through the letters
6. output new string

Additional: 
1. convert the other way around 

Advanced:
1. Convert on the fly (How can I read  a string continuesly? Even possible in the terminal?)
